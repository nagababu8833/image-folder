Vpc(Virutual Private Cloud)
----------------------------------
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated network in the cloud where you can launch and manage your 
resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other services. It gives you control over network settings, such
as IP address ranges, subnets, routing, and security.

Here’s the VPC overview with the asterisks removed:

---

### 1. Subnets  
Definition: Subnets divide the VPC into smaller segments, each associated with a specific availability zone (AZ).  
Types:  
- Public Subnets: Accessible from the internet. Typically used for resources like web servers.  
- Private Subnets: No direct internet access. Used for backend systems like databases.  

---

### 2. Route Tables  
Definition: A route table determines how traffic is directed within the VPC.  
Key Points:  
- Each subnet is associated with one route table.  
- Contains routes to internal subnets, the internet gateway, and other destinations.  

---

### 3. Internet Gateway (IGW)  
Definition: A component that allows communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.  
Key Points:  
- Only public subnets use the IGW.  
- Must attach an IGW to the VPC for internet connectivity.  

---

### 4. NAT Gateway/Instance  
Definition: Allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while remaining inaccessible from the internet.  
Types:  
- NAT Gateway: Managed service, scalable, and reliable.  
- NAT Instance: A manually configured EC2 instance performing NAT functionality.  

---

### 5. Security Groups  
Definition: Acts as a virtual firewall for resources in the VPC.  
Key Points:  
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic to resources.  
- State-based: Replies to allowed requests are automatically permitted.  

---

### 6. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)  
Definition: An optional layer of security at the subnet level.  
Key Points:  
- Stateless: Rules are applied to both inbound and outbound traffic independently.  
- Provides broader control compared to security groups.  

---

### 7. Elastic IPs (EIPs)  
Definition: Static public IP addresses used for persistent internet access.  
Key Points:  
- Assigned to resources like NAT Gateways or EC2 instances in public subnets.  

---

### 8. Endpoints  
Definition: Enables private connections between VPC resources and AWS services without needing an IGW.  
Types:  
- Gateway Endpoints: For S3 and DynamoDB.  
- Interface Endpoints: Uses AWS PrivateLink for other services.  

---

### 9. Peering Connections  
Definition: Connects two VPCs for intercommunication without traversing the internet.  
Key Points:  
- Can connect VPCs in the same or different AWS accounts.  
- No transitive peering (A → B and B → C doesn’t mean A → C).  

---

### 10. VPN Gateway  
Definition: Connects your VPC to an on-premises network securely over a VPN.  
Key Points:  
- Uses IPSec tunnels.  
- Requires a Virtual Private Gateway on the VPC side and a Customer Gateway on the on-premises side.  

---

### 11. Transit Gateway  
Definition: A central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.  
Key Points:  
- Simplifies complex network architectures.  
- Allows transitive routing between connected networks.  

---

### 12. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)  
Definition: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple resources in your VPC.  
Key Points:  
- Operates in public or private subnets.  
- Integrates with Auto Scaling groups.  

---

### VPC Benefits  
- Complete control over network configurations.  
- Logical isolation of resources for enhanced security.  
- Customizable IP address ranges.  
- Secure communication with on-premises data centers.

-------------------------------------

1.create Vpc test-vpc-1 (ip4-CIDR range -12.0.0.0/16)
2.create Vpc test-vpc-2 (ip4-CIDR range -13.0.0.0/16)
3.create route table test-rt-vpc-1 , test-rt-vpc-2 (attach related vpcs)
4.create subnet test-subner-vpc-1 (CIDR-12.0.1.0/24)
5.create subnet test-subnet-vpc-2 (CIDR-13.0.1.0/24)
6.attach test-subner-vpc-1,2 related route table
7.create internet gateway test-ig-vpc-1,2 attach releate route table.
8. create vpc peering and accept that one.
9.routes has to modified with vpc peering .
