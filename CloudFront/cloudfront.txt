AWS CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and
APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches content in edge locations worldwide, 
reducing the load on the origin server and improving performance.

Aws Global Infra Structure:
---------------------------
1.Regions (30)
2.Avalibality zones (90)
3.Data centers (3)
4.Edge Locations (410+) -->pop(point of presence)


distribution:
------------
origin -----> s3,Ec2,elb,mediacore
if using outside (server ip, urls)

try to access expiration time(24 hours) 
set (0-24 hours or maximum)

update (invalidate)

data saving:
-----------
s3 --> Route53 -->distibution(abc.cloudfornt.com)(end point or url) -->browse

example :
-----------
abc.com ---> try to access

### Key Features  
1. Global Content Delivery – Distributes content across multiple edge locations for fast and reliable access.  
2. Caching & Performance Optimization – Reduces latency by caching content at edge locations.  
3. Security Features – Integrates with AWS WAF, AWS Shield, and supports SSL/TLS encryption.  
4. Integration with AWS Services – Works with S3, EC2, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and Lambda@Edge for custom logic 
    at edge locations.  
5. Custom Content Delivery Rules – Supports URL-based routing, query strings, and cache invalidations.  
6. Cost-Effective – Pay-as-you-go pricing with free-tier options.  

### Common Use Cases  
- Website Acceleration – Reduces load time for web pages.  
- Streaming Media – Delivers video-on-demand (VOD) and live streaming content.  
- API Acceleration – Reduces latency for API requests.  
- Security & DDoS Protection – Shields against malicious traffic using AWS WAF & AWS Shield.  
- Software Distribution – Speeds up delivery of large files like software updates.  

### How AWS CloudFront Works  
1. User Request → A user requests content (e.g., an image, video, or webpage).  
2. Edge Location Lookup → CloudFront routes the request to the nearest edge location.  
3. Cache Check → If the content is cached, CloudFront serves it directly.  
4. Fetch from Origin (if necessary) → If not cached, CloudFront retrieves content from the origin (S3, EC2, or 
    an external server).  
5. Cache Update & Delivery → CloudFront caches the response and delivers it to the user.  

### AWS CloudFront with S3 Example  
1. Store static website content in an S3 bucket.  
2. Configure CloudFront to use the S3 bucket as the origin.  
3. Enable SSL/TLS for HTTPS access.  
4. Restrict direct S3 access and serve content via CloudFront.  
5. Use Signed URLs or Signed Cookies for restricted access.  

### CloudFront Pricing  
- Data Transfer Out – Charged based on location and amount of data.  
- Request Pricing – Different rates for HTTP and HTTPS requests.  
- Invalidation Requests – First 1,000 paths per month are free.
