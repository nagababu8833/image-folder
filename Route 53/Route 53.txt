### **Key Features of AWS Route 53:**  
1. **Domain Registration** – Register new domain names or transfer existing ones.  
2. **DNS Routing** – Routes end-user requests to AWS or non-AWS resources.  
3. **Health Checks & Failover** – Monitors the health of resources and supports automatic failover.  
4. **Traffic Flow Management** – Helps optimize routing using geolocation, latency, or weighted routing policies.  
5. **Private DNS for VPC** – Enables DNS resolution within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).  
6. **DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)** – Provides authentication for DNS data.  

### **Routing Policies in Route 53:**  
1. **Simple Routing** – Default routing policy for a single record.  
2. **Weighted Routing** – Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on assigned weights.  
3. **Latency-based Routing** – Routes requests to the region with the lowest latency.  
4. **Geolocation Routing** – Directs traffic based on the user’s geographic location.  
5. **Geoproximity Routing** – Routes traffic based on the user’s proximity to AWS regions.  
6. **Failover Routing** – Routes traffic to a healthy resource when the primary one fails.  
7. **Multivalue Answer Routing** – Provides multiple IP addresses and allows health checks for each.  

### **Common Use Cases:**  
- Hosting static websites using Amazon S3 and CloudFront.  
- Managing domain registration and DNS resolution.  
- Load balancing across AWS regions using latency-based routing.  
- Implementing disaster recovery with failover routing.  
- Securing DNS responses with DNSSEC.
