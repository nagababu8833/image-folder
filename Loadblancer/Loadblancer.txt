AWS offers different types of **Load Balancers** through **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to distribute incoming 
traffic across multiple targets to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

## **Types of AWS Load Balancers**
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
   - Works at **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**
   - Routes requests based on **URL paths, host headers, query parameters, and HTTP headers**
   - Ideal for **microservices and containerized applications** (works well with ECS & EKS)
   - Supports **WebSockets & gRPC**
   - Supports **authentication & SSL termination**
   - round robin algorithm

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
   - Works at **Layer 4 (TCP/UDP/TLS)**
   - Routes traffic based on **IP and port**
   - Supports **extreme performance & low latency**
   - Can handle **millions of requests per second**
   - Ideal for **real-time applications & gaming** with UDP support
   - least out standing algoritm

3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
   - Works at **Layer 3 (IP)**
   - Primarily used for **third-party virtual appliances** (firewalls, IDS/IPS, deep packet inspection)
   - Helps deploy **network security solutions**
   - Supports **auto-scaling of security appliances**

4. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB) (Legacy)**
   - Works at **both Layer 4 & Layer 7** but lacks advanced features of ALB/NLB
   - Mostly **deprecated in favor of ALB/NLB**

## **Key Features of AWS Load Balancers**
âœ… **Auto Scaling**: Automatically distributes traffic across healthy instances  
âœ… **Health Checks**: Monitors instance health and routes traffic only to healthy targets  
âœ… **Security**: Works with **AWS WAF**, **AWS Shield**, and integrates with **IAM roles**  
âœ… **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple Availability Zones  
âœ… **SSL/TLS Termination**: Offloads SSL processing to the load balancer  
âœ… **Sticky Sessions**: Ensures a user session stays connected to the same backend  
âœ… **Logging & Monitoring**: Integrated with **CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, and AWS X-Ray**

## **Use Cases**
- **ALB** â†’ Websites, APIs, and containerized apps  
- **NLB** â†’ High-performance applications, IoT, and gaming  
- **GWLB** â†’ Security appliances like firewalls, IPS/IDS  
- **CLB** (Legacy) â†’ Older applications that still rely on it

## **Integration with AWS Services**
- **Amazon EC2**: Load balance across multiple EC2 instances  
- **Amazon ECS & EKS**: Works seamlessly with Docker containers and Kubernetes  
- **AWS Lambda**: ALB supports direct invocation of Lambda functions  
- **Amazon RDS**: Distributes read traffic across RDS instances using **NLB**  
- **AWS Global Accelerator**: Enhances performance with global traffic routing
