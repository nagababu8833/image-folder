AWS API Gateway: 
=================
=================

AWS API Gateway is a fully managed service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain,
monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as an entry point for applications, allowing them to interact with 
AWS services, databases, and backend systems.

### Key Features of API Gateway  
✔ RESTful & WebSocket APIs – Supports both REST and WebSocket APIs.  
✔ Integration with AWS Services – Works seamlessly with Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and more.  
✔ Security & Authentication – Supports IAM policies, Cognito, and API keys.  
✔ Rate Limiting & Throttling – Protects against abuse and excessive traffic.  
✔ Caching – Reduces backend load by caching responses.  
✔ Logging & Monitoring – Integrated with CloudWatch for insights.

### Types of APIs in API Gateway  
1. REST API – Traditional API that supports RESTful endpoints.  
2. HTTP API – A lightweight version of REST API with lower cost and better performance.  
3. WebSocket API – Enables real-time, bi-directional communication.

---

### Common Use Cases  
✅ Serverless applications (API Gateway + AWS Lambda)  
✅ Microservices API management  
✅ Secure API endpoints with IAM and Cognito  
✅ Rate limiting and request throttling  
✅ Real-time applications using WebSocket APIs

### Example: API Gateway with AWS Lambda  
1. Create an API Gateway REST API.  
2. Define an HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).  
3. Integrate with an AWS Lambda function.  
4. Deploy and test the API.  
5. Secure with IAM roles, API keys, or Cognito.
