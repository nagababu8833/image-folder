## AWS CloudWatch Overview  
AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS resources, applications, and 
services in real time.

### Key Features  
1. Metrics â€“ Collects and monitors performance data from AWS services.  
2. Logs â€“ Captures, stores, and analyzes logs from AWS and on-premise environments.  
3. Alarms â€“ Triggers automated actions based on predefined thresholds.  
4. Dashboards â€“ Provides visualization of metrics and logs.  
5. Events (Amazon EventBridge) â€“ Automates responses to system changes.  
6. ServiceLens â€“ Traces and monitors application performance.  
7. Synthetics â€“ Monitors APIs and web applications using canary scripts.  
8. Contributor Insights â€“ Analyzes patterns in log data for troubleshooting.

## CloudWatch Metrics  
- Metrics are time-series data that measure the performance of AWS resources.  
- Metrics have namespaces (e.g., AWS/EC2, AWS/RDS, AWS/Lambda).  
- Data retention:  
  - 1-minute data: 15 days  
  - 5-minute data: 63 days  
  - 1-hour data: 455 days  
- Custom metrics can be pushed using PutMetricData API.  

### Common Metrics by Service  

| AWS Service  | Key Metrics |  
|-------------|------------|  
| EC2  | CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps, NetworkIn, StatusCheckFailed |  
| RDS  | CPUUtilization, FreeableMemory, ReadIOPS, DBConnections |  
| S3  | NumberOfObjects, BucketSizeBytes, GetRequests, PutRequests |  
| Lambda  | Invocations, Errors, Duration, ConcurrentExecutions |  
| ECS  | CPUUtilization, MemoryUtilization, RunningTaskCount |  
| ALB  | RequestCount, HTTPCode_ELB_5XX, TargetResponseTime |

## CloudWatch Logs  
- Stores logs from AWS services and applications.  
- Logs are grouped into log groups, and each log group has log streams.  
- Logs can be ingested using:  
  - CloudWatch Logs Agent  
  - AWS Lambda  
  - AWS SDK/API  
- Log Retention: Default is indefinite, but can be configured (1 day to 10 years).  

### Common Log Sources  
- EC2 Logs (System logs, application logs)  
- Lambda Logs (console.log in Node.js, print() in Python)  
- VPC Flow Logs (Traffic logs for security monitoring)  
- CloudTrail Logs (AWS API call history)  

---

## CloudWatch Alarms  
- Threshold-based monitoring with automated responses.  
- Can trigger SNS notifications, Auto Scaling actions, Lambda functions, or EC2 recovery.  
- Supports three states:  
  - OK â€“ Metric within threshold  
  - ALARM â€“ Metric exceeds threshold  
  - INSUFFICIENT_DATA â€“ Not enough data to evaluate  

### Types of Alarms  
- Metric Alarms â€“ Trigger based on a single metric.  
- Composite Alarms â€“ Combine multiple alarms for better monitoring.  

---

## CloudWatch Dashboards  
- Customizable visual dashboards for AWS metrics and logs.  
- Can include graphs, text widgets, and log query results.  
- Supports multi-account & multi-region views.  

---

## CloudWatch Events (Amazon EventBridge)  
- Used for event-driven automation.  
- Can capture AWS API calls, state changes, and custom events.  
- Can trigger Lambda, SNS, Step Functions, SQS, etc.  

### Example Use Cases  
- Start/Stop EC2 instances on schedule.  
- Trigger Lambda when an S3 object is uploaded.  
- Detect IAM policy changes and notify admins.  

---

## CloudWatch ServiceLens  
- Provides end-to-end observability for applications.  
- Integrated with AWS X-Ray for tracing.  
- Helps identify bottlenecks, latencies, and failures.  

---

## CloudWatch Logs Insights  
- Query logs in real-time using SQL-like syntax.  
- Supports advanced filtering, aggregations, and visualization.  

### Example Queries  

Find most recent errors:  
```sql  
fields @timestamp, @message  
| filter @message like /ERROR/  
| sort @timestamp desc  
| limit 10  
```  

Count logs per service:  
```sql  
stats count(*) by service  
```  

---

## CloudWatch Synthetics  
- Monitors APIs, URLs, and endpoints for availability.  
- Uses Canary scripts to simulate user behavior.  
- Helps detect downtime and latency issues.  

---

## CloudWatch Contributor Insights  
- Identifies patterns in log data (e.g., most frequent IPs, API calls).  
- Useful for security analysis and performance monitoring.  

---

## Pricing  
- Metrics: First 10,000 metrics free, then $0.30 per metric/month.  
- Logs: Ingestion costs ~$0.50 per GB, and storage ~$0.03 per GB/month.  
- Alarms: Standard alarms ~$0.10 per alarm/month.  
- Events: Free tier includes 1M events; after that, $1.00 per million events.  

---

## Best Practices  
1. Use Alarms for critical metrics (e.g., CPU spikes, high error rates).  
2. Enable Log Retention Policies to avoid unnecessary costs.  
3. Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for efficient log analysis.  
4. Integrate with AWS X-Ray for detailed tracing.  
5. Leverage EventBridge for automated actions.
