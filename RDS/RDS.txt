### Key Features of AWS RDS  
1. Automated Backups & Snapshots – RDS automatically backs up your database and allows point-in-time recovery.  
2. Multi-AZ Deployments – Provides high availability and failover support by replicating data across different a
   vailability zones.  
3. Read Replicas – Improve performance by creating read-only replicas.  
4. Automatic Patching & Maintenance – AWS handles OS and DB engine updates.  
5. Security – Supports encryption at rest (KMS) and in transit (SSL/TLS), IAM-based authentication, and 
   VPC network isolation.  
6. Scalability – Easily scale compute and storage without downtime.  
7. Monitoring & Logging – Integrated with AWS CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Performance Insights.  

### Use Cases  
- Web and mobile applications requiring a managed relational database.  
- Enterprise applications like ERP and CRM.  
- High-availability applications with automatic failover.  
- Scalable and cost-efficient data storage with replication.  

### Pricing  
AWS RDS pricing depends on:  
- Database engine  
- Instance type (e.g., t3.micro, m5.large)  
- Storage (General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, or Magnetic)  
- Data transfer
