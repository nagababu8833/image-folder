## AWS CodePipeline Overview  

### What is AWS CodePipeline?  
AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service
that helps automate the build, test, and deployment phases of your release process. 
It integrates with various AWS services like AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, 
and third-party tools like GitHub, Jenkins, and Bitbucket.

### Key Features of AWS CodePipeline  
1. Automated workflow – Automates code changes from commit to deployment.  
2. Integration support – Works with AWS services (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy) and 
   third-party tools (Jenkins, GitHub, etc.).  
3. Parallel execution – Supports parallel execution of multiple workflows.  
4. Manual approvals – Allows human intervention at key stages before deployment.  
5. Custom actions – Enables custom build and deployment actions.

### AWS CodePipeline Architecture  
CodePipeline consists of multiple stages, where each stage has actions such as:  
- Source stage – Retrieves the source code from AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or S3.  
- Build stage – Compiles and builds the application using AWS CodeBuild or third-party tools.  
- Test stage – Runs unit, integration, and performance tests.  
- Deploy stage – Deploys the built artifact using AWS CodeDeploy, ECS, EKS, or other services.

### Steps to Create an AWS CodePipeline  

1. Set up the source repository  
   - Store your code in AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or Amazon S3.  

2. Configure the build process  
   - Use AWS CodeBuild or Jenkins to compile and package the code.  

3. Define the deployment strategy  
   - Deploy the application using AWS CodeDeploy, ECS, EKS, or Lambda.  

4. Add testing and approval stages (optional)  
   - Run automated tests using AWS CodeBuild.  
   - Add a manual approval stage before deployment.  

5. Monitor and optimize  
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail for logging and monitoring.
